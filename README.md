The coolest coffee brew tracker ever.

### Purpose

To learn how to build a MEAN stack application while building an app that tracks and schedules 'brews' - times when people gather together for a nice cup of coffee.

### Building

You must have mongodb installed and running for Grunt building/testing to work.

Also, as separate tasks, you will need to install `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```
$ bower install
$ npm install
```

Run `grunt` for building, and `grunt serve` for an active preview of the app that 'watches' for changes to files and rebuilds on the fly.
